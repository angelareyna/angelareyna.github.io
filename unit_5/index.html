		<h2>The Process</h2>
		<p>We make tequila the way that tequila has always tasted best: pure and powerful, free of any additives. We do not contract with a distillery for the purchase of liquid. We are completely vertically integrated, ranging from working with the community of agave farmers, distillation management, and aging in our own barrels. Our attention to detail and complete involvement result in a truly spectacular product.</p>
