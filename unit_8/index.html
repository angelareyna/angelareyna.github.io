		<h2>Our Story</h2>
		<p>What if I told you I fell in love with tequila at a young age? You would and should say that's crazy. You should ask how young I was and then maybe text my parents and tell them they are the worst. However, this is the truth. Tequila has always been a part of my life, even if for most of it I could only take a sip. To my family it signified unity, celebration, and most importantly emotion. We know and respect the importance of tequila, and we make every last drop "de corazon". Quality is our signature, we take pride in growing, maintaining and harvesting our own agave, producing a tequila of the finest quality embodied with flavor and aromas pleasing to the palate.</p>

		<h2>The Process</h2>
		<p>We make tequila the way that tequila has always tasted best:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pure</li>
				<li>Powerful</li> 
				<li>Potent</li>
			</ul>

		</div>
		<p>We do not contract with a distillery for the purchase of liquid. We are completely vertically integrated, ranging from working with the community of agave farmers, distillation management, and aging in our own barrels. Our attention to detail and complete involvement result in a truly spectacular product.</p>
